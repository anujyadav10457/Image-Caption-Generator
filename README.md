#Image Caption Generator with Flickr8k 
This project involves developing an Image Caption Generator using the Flickr8k dataset. The primary objective is to build a model that can generate descriptive captions for images by leveraging deep learning techniques. This README file provides a detailed guide on setting up the project, understanding its structure, and running the code.


Image Captioning is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. It involves generating a textual description of an image. This project utilizes the Flickr8k dataset, which consists of 8000 images each annotated with five different captions.
